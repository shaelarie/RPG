<b>Welcome to "Princess Rescue"!</b>

<p>
The Princess of Krishonstoria has been captured by the evil wizard Andrew. King Kristofer is asking everyone to help rescue his beloved daughter.

<p>Your goal is simple: save the Princess of Krishonstoria. But to achieve your goal, you must defeat a number of the wizard's bosses, which include dragons, giants, trolls, witches and other assorted magical creatures. Along the way, you will collect gold bars. If you collect enough gold, the Princess will reward you by becoming your bride.
<P>
<b>Instructions:</b> Choose a character -- Alien, Ninja or Cowboy. As an alien, you are able to maximize damage but have less ability to defend yourself. Ninjas are quick to defend, but do less damage. Cowboys own equal abilities to exact damage and defend. 

<p>Use your Primary Weapon, Secondary Weapon or Defend to battle through each level. Primary Weapon delivers a character's normal damage. Each Secondary Weapon delivers more damage, but causes a decrease in your health. Using Defend allows you to limit the damaged inflicted by the boss. You only have a number of Secondary Weapons and Defends each round.

<p>Are you up to the challenge? Good Luck!
